SQL Queries Overview
The SQL queries included in this portfolio project are categorized based on the analysis performed and the insights derived from the COVID-19 datasets. Here's a brief overview of the main SQL queries included:

# Data Exploration Queries:

Analyze COVID-19 data by selecting specific columns and filtering records based on conditions such as continent presence.

***Statistical Analysis Queries:***
Calculate total cases, total deaths, death percentage, infection rates, and death rates.

***Breakdown by Continent:***
Analyze COVID-19 statistics at a continental level to identify regions with the highest death counts per population.

***Global Numbers:***
Perform global analysis by calculating total cases, total deaths, and death percentages across all locations.

***Vaccination Analysis:***
Analyze vaccination data by calculating the percentage of the population that has received at least one COVID-19 vaccine.

***Creating Views:***
Store intermediate analysis results in views for future reference and visualization purposes.

# Instructions To explore the SQL portfolio project:
